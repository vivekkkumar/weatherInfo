# weatherInfo
This tool was extensively used by me sometime back to check for weather info.

It has dependecny of twilio library which has to be downloaded seperately.

Has 2 libraries, 
  1.  weatherInfo makes a request to the Endpoint to fetch information (Have to register to get app ID information)
  2.  messenger to send application to my number about some required information, to my number.

Basically the tool sends me a message about particular weather change when I run it in my system.
